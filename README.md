ğŸ”­ I'm an Information Security Executive (don't hold it against me), a garage gym work out junky and an energy drink fiend.

    -AWS, GCP and Azure security architecture
    -All EDR/EPP's on the market (no really, I've used them all)
    -SIEM: Splunk, Devo, Azure Sentinel, Backstory, and Graylog
    -Firewalls: Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, Cisco, Sophos and Checkpoint
    -Vulnerability Management: Tenable and Rapid7
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Yara L
